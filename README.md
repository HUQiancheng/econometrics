**My proposal
focuses on the role of FDI in the growth of China’s banking industry. I aim to investigate the long-run effect of outward and inward FDI on the growth of China’s banking industry, and the relationship between total FDI and growth in China’s banking industry. The study will be conducted using secondary time series data for the period between 1992 and 2021. The data will be gathered from the World Bank and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. The data will be analysed through various time series data analysis techniques such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, the Granger causality test, and the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model.**
